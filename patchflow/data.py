    indexes from the tile and patch sizes provided.

    This function generates a single set of patches from the paired
    paths provided and then splits them into three subsets following 
    the specified criteria. This ensures that the patches in each set
    may come from any tile, so their distribution do not skew the 
    results. In no case are the patches generated, only the indexes
    needed to calculate the windows are created in this step, so both
    the amount of processing and the size of the output are very light.

    Args:
        paired_paths: The output of the generate_tile_paths function.

            containing a pair of integers. E.g.: (128, 128).
        validation_size: A real number between 0 and 1 specifying the
            proportion of patches to place in the validation test.
            0.2 by default.
